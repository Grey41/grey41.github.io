			<h2>Ball Physics</h2>

			<iframe id = physics class = iframe></iframe>
			<div class = editor></div>

			<p>
				In this demo, I have tried to make the code as minimal as possible.
				The main collision calculations are done inside the <mark>update</mark> function.
			</p>

			<p>
				To find the distance between two circles, you need to use the <mark>Pythagoras Theorem</mark>.
				The example below will show how this is achieved.
				Once you have the distance, it's easy to calculate collision.
			</p>

			<div class = code>
				<pre>distance = &#8730;(x-distance&#178; + y-distance&#178;)</pre>
			</div>

			<p>
				Feel free to fiddle with the code and make your own combinations.
