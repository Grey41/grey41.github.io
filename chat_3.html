            <h3>3. The Layout</h3>

            <p>
                So far, we have written the setup code for the server and the clients.
                Now we will start coding the layout of our application in <mark>HTML</mark> and <mark>CSS</mark>.
                If you are familiar with styling in <mark>CSS</mark>, then feel free to change the code and make the layout better.
            </p>

            <p>
                Open your <mark>index.html</mark> file and delete the code inside the <mark>body</mark>.
                Then create a new <mark>div</mark> called <mark>main</mark>.
            </p>

            <div class = snippet></div>

            <p>
                Now we want to style the page and position the <mark>div</mark> in the middle of the screen.
            </p>

            <div class = snippet></div>

            <p>
                The <mark>CSS</mark> above makes the page expand to the full height of the window.
                We then make the <mark>div</mark> have a maximum width of <mark>64em</mark> and set its <mark>margin</mark> to <mark>auto</mark>.
                This positions the <mark>div</mark> in the centre of the screen.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you go back to the <mark>localhost:5000</mark> browser window and refresh the page.
                You will see a grey rectangle in the middle of a grey screen.
                If you can't connect, make sure your <mark>Node.js</mark> application is still running in the terminal.
                Go back to the previous page if you can't remember how to run your application.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now we want to make another <mark>div</mark> at the bottom of the page called <mark>base</mark>.
                This is where the user will submit a message.
            </p>

            <div class = snippet></div>

            <p>
                To make our <mark>base div</mark> fit at the bottom of the page, we need to make the height of the <mark>main div</mark> smaller.
                The following <mark>CSS</mark> uses <mark>calc</mark> to subtract from the height of the <mark>main div</mark>.
            </p>

            <div class = snippet></div>

            <p>
                If you run your application at <mark>localhost:5000</mark>, you will see a thin grey rectangle at the bottom of the screen.
            </p>

            <p>
                Inside our <mark>base div</mark> we will now add an <mark>HTML</mark> input box where the user will type their message.
                The <mark>placeholder</mark> value refers to the initial background text inside the box.
            </p>

            <div class = snippet></div>

            <p>
                Now let's style our input box.
                We will give it a curved edge with the <mark>border-radius</mark> value.
            </p>

            <div class = snippet></div>

            <p>
                When you refresh your application, you will have a nice input box where you can type a message.
                Later, we will detect when you type a message and send it to the server.
            </p>

            <p>
                All the messages are going to appear in the main grey box.
                The following code will create a box with a message inside.
                This is just a test and we will remove it later.
            </p>

            <div class = snippet></div>

            <p>
                Let's style the message box.
            </p>

            <div class = snippet></div>

            <p>
                When you refresh your application again, you will see a box with a message inside.
            </p>

            <p>
                We have set up all the <mark>HTML</mark> visuals.
                Feel free to make it fancier and even change the layout.
                On the next page, we will start writing the code that will enable the browser to communicate with the server.
            </p>
