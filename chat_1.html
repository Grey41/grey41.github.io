            <h3>1. Setting Up</h3>

            <p>
                In this tutorial, we will create a simple online chat application.
                The same skills can be used to create multiplayer games and <mark>dynamic</mark> websites.
            </p>

            <p>
                Every website on the <mark>World Wide Web</mark> needs a computer to store it.
                The computer is called a server.
                For example, this website is hosted on <mark>GitHub</mark>.
                This means that whenever you want to visit this website, a <mark>GitHub</mark> server is providing your computer with the data for this website.
            </p>

            <p>
                When building a <mark>static</mark> website, you upload the code to a server that only has to provide users with the website data.
                In this tutorial, we will build a <mark>dynamic</mark> website where we write our own code for the server.
                The server does a lot more work because it is constantly receiving and sending data between users.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our application will have two main parts.
                One part will be for the server and the other part will be for the clients.
                We can write the client part in normal <mark>HTML</mark> but for the server, we need to use a new tool called <mark>Node.js</mark>.
            </p>

            <p>
                <mark>Node.js</mark> was specifically designed for building online applications in <mark>JavaScript</mark>.
                It is a very useful piece of software.
            </p>

            <p>
                To install <mark>Node.js</mark>, visit <a href = https://nodejs.org target = _blank>nodejs.org</a> and download the stable version for your computer.
                On <mark>Windows</mark> and <mark>Mac</mark>, it comes as an installer.
            </p>

            <p>
                To check if everything has worked, type the following into the <mark>Command Terminal</mark> of your computer and press <mark>ENTER</mark>.
            </p>

            <script type = sh>
                ‡node -v
                npm -v‡
            </script>

            <p>
                If any errors appear, then you have a problem.
                If you need help installing <mark>Node.js</mark>, you can either find a more detailed installation guide or contact us at <a href = mailto:info@greyhope.uk>info@greyhope.uk</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once you have successfully installed <mark>Node.js</mark>, make a new folder on your computer and name it <mark>chat-app</mark>.
                Inside the folder, add a file called <mark>server.js</mark>.
                Open the file and write the following code.
            </p>

            <script type = javascript>
                ‡console.log("hello")‡
            </script>

            <p>
                Now go to the <mark>Command Terminal</mark> and type <mark>cd</mark> followed by the file path of your <mark>chat_app</mark> folder.
                Based on where you put the folder, the file path will be different.
            </p>

            <script type = sh>‡cd path/to/chat-app‡</script>

            <p>
                Now type the following into the terminal.
            </p>

            <script type = sh>‡node server.js‡</script>

            <p>
                The terminal should then print <mark>hello</mark>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now we need to set up our <mark>chat-app</mark> folder.
                Type the following into the terminal.
            </p>

            <script type = sh>‡npm init‡</script>

            <p>
                It will then ask questions about your new package.
                You can type the following answers.
            </p>

            <script type = text>
                package name: (chat-app)
                version: (1.0.0)
                description: A basic online chat application
                entry point: (server.js)
                test command:
                git repository:
                keywords: chatting online fun
                author: Your Name
                license: (ISC)
            </script>

            <p>
                Confirm everything by pressing <mark>ENTER</mark>.
                It should then create a single file called <mark>package.json</mark> in your <mark>chat-app</mark> folder.
                This file contains all the information you just entered.
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, we want to include two important packages for our application.
                They are <mark>Socket.IO</mark> and <mark>Express</mark>, they will be explained later.
                Type the following into the terminal.
            </p>

            <script type = sh>‡npm install --save express socket.io‡</script>

            <p>
                It should then create a file called <mark>package-lock.json</mark> and a folder called <mark>node_modules</mark>.
                If this works, you are ready to move on to the next page where we will start coding our program.
            </p>
