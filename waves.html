			<p>
				Even though this demo may seem overwhelming, the concept is quite simple.
				If you lower the <mark>RESOLUTION</mark> value, you will notice that the waves are made of hundreds of sections.
			</p>

			<p>
				Each wave section has its own speed and height that is affected by the sections either side of it.

			<p>
				To take this demo a step further, you could try to add proper splashes.
				This wave feature is very useful for simulating water without using particles.
