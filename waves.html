                Even though this demo may seem overwhelming, the concept is quite simple.
                Although the waves look smooth, they are actually made of hundreds of sections.
                The <mark>RESOLUTION</mark> value controls the amount of sections.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each wave section has its own speed and height that is affected by the sections either side of it.
            </p>

            <p>
                To take this demo a step further, you could try to add proper splashes.
                This wave feature is very useful for simulating water without using particles.
