            <h3>5. Publishing</h3>

            <p>
                This page will explain how to publish your app with <mark>Heroku</mark>.
                <mark>Heroku</mark> is a user friendly platform for online applications.
                Although some <mark>Heroku</mark> packages are paid for, you can host up to five applications for free.
                The main downside with the free package is that the server goes to sleep after <mark>30</mark> minutes of inactivity.
                When the server is asleep and a client visits the site, it takes a while for the page to load.
            </p>

            <p>
                All <mark>Heroku</mark> applications need to be <mark>Git</mark> repositories.
                Visit <a href = https://git-scm.com target = _blank>git-scm.com</a> and install the latest version of <mark>Git</mark> for your computer.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now visit <a href = https://heroku.com target = _blank>heroku.com</a> and sign up.
                Go to the <a href = https://devcenter.heroku.com target = _blank>devcenter</a> and click on the <mark>Node.js</mark> button.
                Click the <mark>Get started with Node.js</mark> button and then <mark>I'm ready to start</mark>.
                Install <mark>Heroku</mark> by following the instructions on the <mark>Set up</mark> page.
            </p>

            <p>
                Before we deploy our app, we need to write one last bit of code in the <mark>server.js</mark> file.
            </p>

            <div class = snippet></div>

            <p>
                The code above tells the server to look for the <mark>Heroku</mark> port instead of running on <mark>localhost:5000</mark>.
                If it can't find the port, it will run on <mark>localhost:5000</mark>.
            </p>

            <p>
                We don't want to upload the whole <mark>node_modules</mark> folder to <mark>Heroku</mark> so we need to add a new file that tells <mark>Git</mark> what to ignore.
                Add a new file to your <mark>chat-app</mark> folder named <mark>.gitignore</mark>.
                Open it and write the following code.
            </p>

            <pre>/node_modules</pre>

            <p>
                Go to the <mark>Command Terminal</mark> and type <mark>cd</mark> followed by the path to your <mark>chat-app</mark> folder.
            </p>

            <pre>cd [file path] chat-app</pre>

            <p>
                Type the following into the terminal.
            </p>

            <pre>git init</pre>

            <p>
                If you go to your <mark>chat-app</mark> folder and veiw the hidden files, you will have a new folder called <mark>.git</mark>.
                Write the following command in the terminal.
            </p>

            <pre>git add .</pre>

            <p>
                Then commit your new repository.
            </p>

            <pre>git commit -m "First Release"</pre>

            <p>
                Repository complete.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now we can deploy our application to <mark>Heroku</mark>.
                In the terminal, type the following.
            </p>

            <pre>heroku login</pre>

            <p>
                It will then ask you to press any key.
                Once you've done that, <mark>Heroku</mark> will open a new browser tab.
                Click <mark>Login</mark> and close the tab.
                Now type the following.
            </p>

            <pre>heroku create</pre>

            <p>
                <mark>Heroku</mark> will then think of a random name for your app.
                If this troubles you, you can change it later.
                Finally, type the following command.
            </p>

            <pre>git push heroku main</pre>

            <p>
                If you have an error, you may want to type <mark>git checkout -b main</mark> in the terminal and then try again.
                Now type the following to open your application.
            </p>

            <pre>heroku open</pre>

            <p>
                You should then be taken to your application online.
                If you get your friends to visit your application, you will be able to chat to each other!
                Well done! You have completed the whole tutorial.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you want to rename your app, type the following.
            </p>

            <pre>heroku apps:rename [new name]</pre>
